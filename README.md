# autoGPU
my gpu kept crashing and instead of spending a few seconds to reconfigure my settings i spent hours figuring out how to automatically do it

do note that this is quite hacky and will basically only work for *my* gpu since it detects the default clocks in order to change them.

if you for some reason find yourself in the same situation, which i will say is *really* strange, feel free to just steal my code as a reference to do the same thing for your gpu.
